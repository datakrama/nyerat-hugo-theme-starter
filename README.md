# Hugo template with Nyerat theme

This is Hugo template built with [Nyerat] theme. This template is made for those
of you who want to start using the [Nyerat] theme with minimal effort.

## Getting started

Use this deploy button to get your own copy of the repository.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/datakrama/nyerat-hugo-theme-starter&stack=cms)

This will set up everything needed for running the theme:

- A new repository in your GitHub (or GitLab) account
- Auto-update theme with GitHub Actions
- Full Continuous Deployment to Netlify's global CDN network
- Manage users with Netlify Identity
- Manage content with Netlify CMS

After the initial build is complete, a confirmation email is sent to your
Netlify account email.

> Because of how [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/identity-generated-emails/#email-templates)
> works by default, the confirmation url will take you to the homepage. You have
> to change the URL manually in the browser.  
> Example:  
<https://example.com/#invite_token=yourtokenhere> becomes <https://example.com/cms/#invite_token=yourtokenhere>

Now you're all set, and you can start adding content!
